# Rain Hero

Rain Hero is a Telegram Bot providing 30-minute predictions for rainfall at any location in Singapore.

## Getting started
** We have currently paused the hosting of Rain Hero â€“ feel free to check out the repository in the meantime.

Simply click [here](https://t.me/rainhero_bot) to open the bot on Telegram on your browswer or application. 

## Tools used

The bot is built using the [`telegram.bot`](https://github.com/ebeneditos/telegram.bot) API wrapper on R. The implementation is currently under work to be moved to the more featureful [`python-telegram-bot`](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) API.  

Modelling and pulling from data sources is done in R.  
SQL Server is used for the database.
